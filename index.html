        <h2>What is zerowaste?</h2>
        <p>Zero waste is a kind of philosophy, a way of life.
        He calls for the maximum reduction in the amount of
        waste that each of us leaves behind us.
        And we leave a lot of things that are ugly :)</p>
        <p>A man is so arranged that he does not want to see and hear the unpleasant, so few people wonder what happens to a small, seemingly, bag of garbage after landing it in a garbage can. And this is what happens: year after year, your small waste package turns into a huge, slowly rotting pile, which decays for 700 years. Even it sounds disgusting, is not it?</p>
        <p>Now the problem of contamination of the planet with the same
        plastic is very acute. In order to realize how badly everything is,
        it is advisable to glimpse at least one glimpse of <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/oceans/preventing-plastic-pollution/key-facts-plastic-pollution/">Greenpeace's captivating article</a> ,
        a note about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch">Pacific garbage patch</a> Pacific waste spill on Wikipedia and convincing 
        material on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/06/plastic-planet-waste-pollution-trash-crisis/">National Geographic</a> National Geographic. Put aside the solution to this crisis and wait
        for governments to wake up once.</p>

         <h2>The main principles of Zero waste</h2>
         <p>The main principles of Zero waste are described as 5R:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>refuse (refuse);</li>
             <li>reduce (reduce consumption);</li>
             <li>reuse + repair (reuse or repair); </li>
             <li>recycle;</li>
             <li>rot (compost)</li>
         </ul>
         <p><i><b>Refuse</b></i> - refuse from the trash and things that really do not need 
         or which can be replaced by reusable brethren. For example, juice in
         a cafe is well drunk and without a tube, bananas on the way from the
         supermarket to the house perfectly feel themselves without a package,
         and coffee can be: a) do not take with you, but sit and drink it in
         a beautiful coffee shop or b) take in his mug . Do not take the unnecessary - 
         flyers, balls, stickers in supermarkets, etc., after all, you will throw them away 
         almost immediately, right? So why take :)</p>
     <div class="images-small">
         <div ><img src="img/zerowaste.jpg" alt="img.zerowaste" class="img-small"></div>
         <div><img src="img/kitchen.jpeg" alt="img.kitchen" class="img-small"></div>
     </div>
     <p><i><b>Reduce</b></i> - reduce consumption, buy as much as you need. 
     Better less than more :) For example, the average European family throws
     out a quarter of the purchased products. And if you think: they have thrown
     out the products, they are rotten and everything, then everything is not so
     simple. Together with them, they went to the trash and emissions of CO2 for
     cultivation and delivery, and thousands of liters of water and fertilizers,
     and the time of dozens or even hundreds of people. In my opinion, this is a
     terrible waste.</p>
    <p><i><b>Reuse + repair</b></i> is about used items and items and that it is not necessary
    to rush to throw out what has failed. Maybe this hole on your favorite jeans
    can be somehow decorated? Or if not, then sew from them a bag for trips to
    the market. There are many variants, we recall the program "Humous Handles
    and Works" :)</p>
    <p><i><b>Recycle</b></i> - recycle. Here, I think, everything is clear: we sort the waste,
    give it for processing. By the way, only metal and glass can be processed 
    infinitely, plastic and paper have limitations in several cycles. 
    Therefore, when buying products, we prefer glass or metal containers.</p>

        <div><img src="img/sorting.jpg" alt="Containers for garbage"></div>
    </div>
    <p><i><b>Rot</b></i> - Compost Organic. If you follow all the preceding
    principles, then only the remains of the food products: vegetables,
    fruits,eggs, and the like will be in the bin. All this good can be turned 
    into fertilizer for the soil. There are special compost buckets and a 
    certain technology.</p>
